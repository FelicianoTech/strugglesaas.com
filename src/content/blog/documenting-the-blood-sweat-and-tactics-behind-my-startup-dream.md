:wave: Welcome to *Struggle SaaS*, my new blog documenting the journey of building Melitix Events and the struggle leading up to it.

## Why

I’m building a “nights & weekends” startup with a friend I’ve known since middle school.
Right in that previous sentence, there are a few points of potential hardship ahead:

1. **nights & weekends**—Building something just on your nights and weekends is hard. I know. I’ve tried many times before and have failed again and again. My financial situation means I don’t have a choice at the moment to do this full-time.
1. **with a friend**—This can also be tricky. Doing business with friends or family can be a double-edged sword. If things go wrong, there’s a risk of ruining important relationships. On the upside, many, such as [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/faq#can-a-single-person-apply-for-funding) and [Rob Walling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDaa5VNfhD0), suggest that more than one founder can be better for a business.

I know this will be hard, and I might fail again.
This time, however, I want to document it.
I will learn more from the experience, and you, dear reader, can learn something from my experiences as well.
There's something about working in public that I think will motivate me.

## The blogging strategy

The plan is to start each week with a new post covering what happened in my startup journey over the previous seven days, going over planning, discussions, metrics, launches, etc.

Some weeks might be uneventful.
Maybe a tiny vacation, a tactic put into play that takes more than a week to judge the results; who knows?
For these weeks, I plan to dive into a story from my past or deep dive into something startup-related that I’ve learned.
