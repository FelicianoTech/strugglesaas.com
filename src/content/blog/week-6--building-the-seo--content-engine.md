I'm going to be straight with you.
This week's post is short and sweet.
My motorcycle trip could have gone better.
After 22,000+ miles, my Harley had its first breakdown; the front cylinder had a hole in it!

Anyway, you can understand why I was physically and mentally unable to move forward with the company last week.
I wanted to quickly dive into my focus this next week, getting content marketing started.

Content marketing is beneficial.
Unlike "traditional" marketing, such as ads, it involves creating blog posts, videos, pictures, etc., to drum up interest in your space and, hopefully, your company.
The return on investment isn't immediate; it takes quite a bit of time.

[Melitix.com](https://melitix.com) is currently a landing page.
Over the next week or two, I will turn it into a full-blown marketing website with a blog as its first section.
I need ideas for the first several blog posts.
If you have any, please let me know in the comments below.

Melitix will have two types of users: event organizers and attendees.
Until I have evidence to show otherwise, my hunch is that marketing and sales efforts should target event organizers.
With that in mind, the initial blog posts will be geared toward educating current and future event organizers.

The decision to open-source the Melitix code (as EventHunt) is so that if the company fails, at least something good will come out of it.
This same notion applies to the Melitix blog.
I want to put good tools, content, and whatever into the world.
I believe in trading in goodwill.

Until next week,
