Over the past two weeks, I've primarily been working on branding for Melitix Events and EventHunt.
I've done this kind of work for many projects before, so it's not unfamiliar.
Around the start of these two weeks, my co-founder quit the "business", making the whole process a bit awkward and demotivating for me.
I pushed through and wanted to share what I have and the experience of losing a co-founder so early.


## Step One :arrow_forward: - EventHunt Branding

Last week, [I wrote about my process](/blog/week-2--open-source-branding/) of creating a brand for [EventHunt](https://EventHunt.org), the open-source event management software that will be powering [Melitix Events](https://Melitix.com).
As such, I won't go into detail again, but here's the logo as a refresher:

What I will touch on is my frustration with Instagram.
Last week I mentioned how the Instagram and Threads accounts for EventHunt were suspended for "violating the community guidelines".
There's an appeal process available, which I completed by giving them some additional information and sending in a picture of myself.
The result of the appeal was the accounts being locked for good. :angry:

I still don't know what specific community guideline I supposedly broke, nor how I could have, considering I didn't get to use the account.
Instagram initially suspended the account within 24 hours of me creating it.
For now, this is a dead end.


## Step Two :arrow_forward: - Melitix Events Branding

This past week, I completed the artwork for Melitix Events.
I've already given most of my thought process around the logo creation [last week](/blog/week-2--open-source-branding/), so I won't repeat it here.
Instead, my big thought challenge this time was determining whether I wanted Melitix Events and EventHunt to share the same icon/symbol in the logo.

### The Canonical Example
For example, Ubuntu, a community software project, uses the "circle of friends" symbol in its logo.
For the Ubuntu project, they put the wordmark "Ubuntu" next to it.
Canonical is the company that makes Ubuntu, and for that logo, they use the same icon but the wordmark "Canonical".

<style type="text/CSS">
.side2side{
    display:flex;
    flex-wrap:wrap;
    justify-content: center;
}
.side2side figure{
    max-width: 300px;
}
</style>
<div class="side2side">
{{< figure src="ubuntu-logo.jpg" >}}
{{< figure src="canonical-logo.jpg" >}}
</div>


### The Automattic Example
WordPress, the most popular website software in the world, takes the opposite approach.
The open-source software has its own distinct logo.
Automattic, the company behind WordPress, shares colors but uses a different logo.

<div class="side2side">
{{< figure src="wordpress-logo.jpg" >}}
{{< figure src="automattic-logo.jpg" >}}
</div>

I thought about this a lot.
My initial feeling was to go with the EventHunt icon and use a shared color—lighter for EventHunt and darker for Melitix.
I was excited about this early on, but a concern regarding copyright sunk the feeling.

As it's open-source, I want people to use the EventHunt logo freely.
Don't get me wrong, I still plan on protecting it from misuse, but if someone's excited about the project and wants to share artist forms of the logo, I want to encourage that.
I would be much more protective and concerned if it were also the company logo.
To avoid this future stress, I decided to go the Automattic route and use a different symbol for Melitix Events.
I also used one of my favorite greens for the color.

{{< figure src="/assets/img/melitix-logo-full.png" width="500px" class="aligncenter" title="Melitix Events Logo" >}}

I won't explain the symbol design or colors for now.
I'm curious what your thoughts on what you see and why.


## Step Three :arrow_backward: - Losing a Co-Founder

Melitix Events has been a long time coming.
As teenagers, my co-founder and I started a different version of this idea.
One of these days, I'll tell that story because it's imperative to my life.
We went down different paths in life, with mine taking a turn to attending hackathons, local meet-ups, and conferences for both work and pleasure.

### Starting Together
Meetup.com was an excellent find for me and an intro to this world.
I learned about the space after attending or hosting many events in New York, San Franciso, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Memphis.
Attending events gave me insights, but organizing my own events exposed what I thought were many shortcomings with the available tools.
After these ideas bounced around in my head for several years, I finally decided to tackle building the business.
I asked my friend if he would want to do it with me.
He happily agreed.

We signed a co-founders agreement at the beginning of this month, March 1st.
Ten days later, after a lengthy discussion, he submitted his resignation.
The situation is still fresh, and as it's dealing with another person's life, I won't get into the details of what happened.
I will say that I was unhappy with how the partnership was going, and I asked him to step down.
He did. I've felt miserable since.

### Loss of Momentum
It was the right decision for him to resign, I know that.
I expected to feel relief from the stress, but I simply exchanged it for another emotion.
I suddenly felt really, really lonely—the excitement of starting something with a friend that would be great and finally getting somewhere vanished.
I was left wondering about my decision-making and feeling the weight of what I wanted to accomplish lay solely on my shoulders.

I named this blog Struggle SaaS because I know that through every project or goal I've had, I went through a level of struggle, whether or not it ended in success or failure.
I started this blog because sometimes I want to quit prematurely.
Whether it's a lack of confidence, shiny object syndrome, or some say fear, many of us don't follow through with a project.
This blog is public to serve as an incentive to keep going, even if it's scary.

Speaking of scary, I will launch the first version of EventHunt in April, even though I don't think it's ready.
It's terrifying stuff. :joy:
We'll get into it next week.

Until next week,
