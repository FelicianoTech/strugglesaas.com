Hey folks, this past Sunday (April 21st) was the first Sunday I haven't published since this blog started.
I'm not happy about it.
Keeping a weekly pace took a lot of work.
In that light, there will be some changes to this blog to make it more sustainable for me.

**Publishing Cadence**—My journaling of building Melitix Events will continue, now bi-weekly.
The intention is to give me more material to write about on particularly slow weeks of Melitix Events.

**Monday Posts**—These Melitix Event journals will now be published on Monday mornings instead of Sunday afternoons.

**General SaaS Musings**—The Melitix Events journals will be posted in their own category on the blog every two weeks.
Outside of this schedule, I plan to post occasional thoughts on SaaS concepts, examples, and stories.
