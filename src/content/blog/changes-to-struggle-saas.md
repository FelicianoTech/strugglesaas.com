Hey folks, this past Sunday (April 21st) was the first Sunday I haven't published since this blog started.
I'm not happy about it.
Keeping a weekly pace took a lot of work.
In that light, there will be some changes to this blog to make it more sustainable for me.

**Publishing Cadence**—My journaling of building Melitix Events will continue, now bi-weekly.
The intention is to give me more material to write about on particularly slow weeks of Melitix Events.

**Monday Posts**—These Melitix Event journals will now be published on Monday mornings instead of Sunday afternoons.

**General SaaS Musings**—The Melitix Events journals will be posted in their own category on the blog every two weeks.
Outside of this schedule, I plan to post occasional thoughts on SaaS concepts, examples, and stories.

## Post Comments

On most of my blogs, I use Disqus to power the comment system.
I got an email from them saying that free plans (which I use) will start showing ads.
Sure enough, on [www.Feliciano.Tech](http://www.Feliciano.Tech), my comments section has begun showing ads and I'm not okay with that.
Before Struggle SaaS's comment section also started to show ads, I decided to swap out the system.

My Discourse forum, [FTech Discuss](https://discuss.feliciano.tech), will now power comments on this website.
Please create an account to make comments.
The same account/forum will soon be used on my personal website as well as the discussion platform for many of my open-source projects.
