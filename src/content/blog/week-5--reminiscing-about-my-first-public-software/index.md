Hey folks.
I'm on a motorcycle trip from Florida to Texas to see the 2024 solar eclipse.
On top of that, I'm still in the middle of the code rewrite I [discussed last week](/blog/week-4--launching-melitix-next-month-yet-starting-a-rewrite/).
As you can imagine, I haven't gotten much done this past week, so there is little to discuss.
While I was roaring west on Interstate 10, my mind was on the EventHunt launch later this month and how it would feel to have the software public.
I then started thinking about the first time I published software for public use and what that experience was like.
It all started with Sony's PlayStation Portable, a.k.a. PSP.

## The PlayStation Portable changed everything for me

I don't remember exactly when I got my first PSP, but I remember it was a game changer.
Coming from the GameBoy Advance, the PSP was a state-of-the-art beast.
It had a bigger, better screen, more mature games, better graphics, memory card support, and more.
I was as excited as any kid to play games on it, but I was also excited to see if I could tinker.
At this time in my life, I've moved on from taking apart things around the house, such as vacuums (boy was my dad mad), and started to get into coding, making websites, and hacking on the computer.
The PSP was this shiny, new machine, but what could it do?
Whatever I could come up with, apparently.

### The homebrew scene
I stumbled upon an online community of hackers, tinkerers, and programmers who hacked the PSP and began to create and share software we called "homebrew".
This was software; it could be a game or an app custom-written to run on hacked PSPs.
It allowed indie developers around the globe to write software for others to run on the PSP without having to be a large company, sign a contract with Sony, etc.
PSP homebrew is a whole thing with a lot of history I won't get into here, but Wikipedia has an excellent [page on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable_homebrew).

Anyway, I dove headfirst into this community, hacking my PSP, downloading games, and having so much fun.
Then, in 2007, a website called *PSP-Hacks* launched a homebrew competition.
They wanted people to write unique homebrew for the PSP and submit it for the competition.
I don't remember the prizes, but I'm sure it was PSP-related.
I saw the competition announcement and was intrigued, excited, and nervous, as I feel with building Melitix now.
I wasn't a strong programmer and had never coded in the C programming language before (what the PSP used), but I decided to enter the competition.
I made a game.


## Simon Remix

This competition would be my first time writing C, my first time publishing code for others, and my first time making a game.
Due to all those challenges, I decided not to waste time developing an idea for a new game.
Instead, I decided to remake a straightforward game.
I choose the old-school game by Hasbro, Simon.

My version was called Simon Remix.
After a few iterations, I got it to work.
It was a real, working game that people could play on their PSP.
I wrote the code, the copy for the competition, most graphics, and the logo.
I submitted my game to the competition and ended up winning 7th place (to my recollection).
My game got a couple hundred downloads via the main competition website and several other PSP download sites.

### A major success

Winning 7th place and having a couple hundred downloads was huge for me.
I may not have won the competition, but I accomplished something I wasn't even sure I was capable of.
More importantly, I got the experience of having many people out on the Internet using software I wrote myself, at home, on my computer.
That reach, that feeling, was nothing like I've ever felt before.

The world became a bit smaller.
I had a new ability.
I could make something that gave someone else entertainment and value.
As a kid, I already knew I liked "business" for a few years before this, but now I also knew I liked making software.

P.S. Several years later, I worked in customer support at one of my favorite Internet companies, Linode.
I was telling this story to a group of my co-workers one evening (on night shift), and it turns out that one of them had downloaded Simon Remix and played it.
What are the freakin' chances? :slight-smile:

Until next week,
