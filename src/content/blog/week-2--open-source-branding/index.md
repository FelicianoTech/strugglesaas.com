Brandingâ€”I'm no expert, but I acknowledge its importance and power when done right.
Starting on this journey of building an event management platform meant starting with branding.
Every business benefits from good branding, but in the open-source world, it's especially needed.


## Branding gives direction

In [episode 58](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/to-be-continuous/ep-58-no-roadmap-for-open-source) of the To Be Continuous podcast, [Paul Biggar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulbiggar/) (CircleCI co-founder) rants about how open-source projects need a roadmap and direction and how significant a problem it is.
I agree and add that branding is also missing from open-source.
Like a product roadmap, branding adds direction and sets expectations for a project.

### For users

Some may yell blasphemy, but Apple doesn't always put out the best hardware.
Try charging a Magic Mouse if you don't believe me.
For decades, what Apple has done well is branding.
Branding can provide subtle or not-so-subtle cues to a person on whether or not this product or company is right for them and whether it's worth their time.
I wanted to start on the right foot with future EventHunt and Melitix users, so I immediately started the branding.

### For me

Choosing to focus on branding first was for more than just potential users.
It was a decision I made as a productivity hack.
Like many devs with tons of "ideas", my brain gets bored quickly and wants to jump onto the next project.
I don't want to make that mistake here.
Getting the initial branding done with a pretty logo on the website, my Trello board, and the social media accounts does something chemically to my brain.
The project feels more real, and I feel a greater sense of attachment to it.
Silly? Maybe.
If it helps me keep my head down and focused, I'll take it.


## Melitix Events vs EventHunt

I needed to brand both the company Melitix Events and the open-source project EventHunt.
I knew what I wanted going in.
I wanted Melitix as the company to have a bold, sharp, professional look and feel.
For EventHunt, I wanted a very "open-source" feel.
I wanted it to be friendly, inviting, and wellâ€¦ have a mascot.
This past week, I decided to tackle EventHunt's branding first.


## Branding EventHunt

I looked at the competing tools, Meetup and Mobilizon, and their logos.
It wasâ€¦ interesting. ðŸ˜•
Meetup has some sort of blob or splash as their logo, and Mobilizon has slightly touched up text.
Nothing that helped or inspired me.
I even looked at Eventbrite, which has just a lowercase 'e'. :shrug:

That didn't help.
I knew I wanted two things going inâ€”some sort of "map pin" in the logo and a mascot.
Let's start with the pin.
Whenever I thought about what this logo could look like, I kept thinking of a pin or marker that one might see on Google Maps.
Something like this:

{{< figure src="map-pin.jpg" width="300px" class="aligncenter" >}}

I see EventHunt's UI focusing heavily on maps, and when it comes to pointing things out on a map, I think pins.
I played with several colors, shapes, and styles of pins, trying to determine what felt right.
I didn't get very far.
There were many designs, but they all felt bland to me.
I decided to switch to thinking about the mascot instead.

### Mascots

Does the project need a mascot? No.
I really, really wanted one, though.
Many of my favorite open-source projects (and even companies) have mascots that I just adore.
Go has the gopher, Trello has Taco, Mastodon has theâ€¦ mastodon, and Linux has Tux, the penguin.

<style type="text/CSS">
.side2side{
    display:flex;
    flex-wrap:wrap;
    justify-content: center;
}
.side2side figure{
    max-width: 300px;
}
</style>
<div class="side2side">
{{< figure src="gopher.jpg" title="Go's gopher" >}}
{{< figure src="taco.jpg" title="Trello's Taco" >}}
{{< figure src="mastodon.jpg" title="Mastodon's mastodon" >}}
{{< figure src="tux.jpg" title="Linux's Tux" >}}
</div>

I wanted to use a tiger, my favorite animal, but tigers aren't very social.
The mascot for an event platform should be a social animal, right?
During my research for social animals and pins, penguins frequently come up.
I don't want to rip off Linux, but a penguin feels like a fitting choice.
I would do something very different than Linux's weird penguin.
Something more playful.
I was thinking along the lines of this:

{{< figure src="two-penguins.jpg" width="400px" class="aligncenter" >}}

I ran the idea by my wife and she agreed.
I started looking for ideas and finished artwork that combined the concepts of pins and penguins and found one that did exactly that.
I reached out to the artist, and I purchased this logo:

{{< figure src="original-logo.jpg" width="200px" class="aligncenter" >}}

It combines a pin and a penguin with a simple design that I could use in small sizes.
I could use it as the favicon and directly on a map as a marker.
It's possible I might make some slight tweaks in the future, but as of today, this is the icon for EventHunt.

### African Influence

I put some of the same thinking into choosing color and font.
I've been playing with various greens and blues for the project.
Early in the week, I decided to use a bold green for Melitix, leaving EventHunt with blue.
Between the blue skies over Antarctica, the coat of [Blue penguins](https://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/little_blue_penguin), and the slight blue of African penguin chicks, blue felt like a great choice.

As for the font, I chose [Madimi One](https://tavatake.github.io/madimi-website/).
It's playful and curvy, like the logo.
The font was designed by two people who took inspiration from southern African symbols.
The African penguin previously mentioned happens to live in South Africa and is one of five endangered penguin species.

Putting it all together, here's the logo as it is today:



What do you think?
Please comment below or contact me on social media if you have any feedback on the logo.
I would love to hear it.

Speaking of social media, I have created accounts.
You can follow EventHunt on [Mastodon](https://nanobyte.cafe/@EventHunt) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EventHuntHQ).

## Some Struggles

You may have noticed some popular social media options missing above.
I made Instagram and Threads accounts; however, Instagram decided that the account was suspicious and suspended it. :angry:
Since Threads uses Instagram for authentication, guess what also got suspended!? :expressionless:

Sadly, a much bigger problem this last week was my co-founder stepping down from the company.
I won't go into that now, but it could be a story for another day.

Until next week,
